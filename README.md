## DNA Toolkit

This repository introduces DNA Toolkit, a collection of functions tailored for manipulating biological sequences to derive meaningful insights. The functionalities include calculating 
nucleotide frequencies, performing transcription, determining GC content, generating translated sequences, obtaining codon counts, analyzing reading frames, 
and extracting protein information.

### BioSeq Class

The core of this toolkit is the `BioSeq` class implemented in the `bioseq` file. This class enables the initiation of a sequence along with specifying its type and label. 
By utilizing the methods from the DNA Toolkit, it seamlessly applies similar functionalities to both DNA and RNA sequences.
